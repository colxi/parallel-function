**Create a new thread with your function**, and keep it ready to be called as many times you need, **asynchronously** in the background, **without blocking your main thread event loop**.

#### Features 
[x] Generate/Destroy threaded functions on demmand.
[x] Execute your functions as a regular async function call.
[x] Unlsease the power of multithreading keeping your code clean.
[x] Compatible with Promise.race() & Promise.all()
[x] Availability to use the power of Transfereable Objects and sharedArrayBuffers.
[x] Browser support : Firefox 59,  Edge 41, Chrome 65
[ ] Node support... Â¿Soon?

> **Note : Until Workers are available in Node, this library is exclusive for Browsers.**



## Syntax 


> let myParallelFunction = new ParallelFunction( myFunction [ ,onMessageHandler ] );

#### Parameters
- **myFunction**  *function,required*
    Function to be executed in the worker
- **onMessageHandler** *function*
    Function to handle the messages sent from the worker using postMessage

## Return
The ParallelFunction Constructor returns an interface function, to perform the async calls. Each call will return a Promise :

> myParallelFunction( ...args );

A method for destroying the instance :

> myParallelFunction.**destroy()**;

And it also provides some methods to perform some Worker related tasks, wich behave as the starndard describes. For more infomation about them, check the [ Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker)

> myParallelFunction.**postMessage( message, transferList )**;
> 
> myParallelFunction.**onMessage( handler )**;
> 
> myParallelFunction.**terminate()**;


## Usage 

A minimal example, to interact with a ParallelFunction :
```javascript
    // Generate a ParallelFunction to calculate Pi,  
    // with customizable precision. The bigger
    // is n, the  longuer is going to take
    let calculatePi = new ParallelFunction( function(n){
        var v = 0;
        for(let i=1; i<=n; i+=4) v += ( 1/i ) - ( 1/(i+2) );
        return 4*v;
    });
    // perform the calculation in the background, with different
    // precision , and in consecuence calculation speeds
    calculatePi(1000000).then( r=> console.log(r) );
    calculatePi(1000000000).then( r=> console.log(r) );
    
    // if you preffer you can use the Promise await keyword
    // insid async functions
    (async function(){
	    console.log( await calculatePi(1000000000) );
        // destroy the ParallelFunction
        calculatePi.destroy();
    })()
   
    


```
## Installation
Use any of the following distribution channels:
- Global **CDN**
```
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/colxi/parallel-function/814e4698/parallel-function.js"></script>
```

- Use **npm**
``` 
$ npm -i parallel-function
```

- Clone from **github**
```
https://github.com/colxi/parallel-function
```

## How it works 
The mechanism is pretty simple and straight forward.
> ParallelFunction = **Blobs + Workers + Promises** 

The library injects into a new Worker, a Blob containing the code of the communication layer, and the provided function, and handles each function call adding it to the messages queue, using a unique index ID.
When a call is returned, it resolves the Promise associated with the call ID. 


## Notes :
- Because each request needs to be messaged to the worker, and its result, messaged back, all interactions with the function are **ASYNCHRONOUS**.

- **Your Parallel Function doesn't run in the same scope where  was declared , but in an isolate scope inside a worker**, this means, it cannot reach any variable declared in the main thread. However has acces to all the methods of the [Web Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope)

- Only those values wich can be handled by the  [Structure Clone Algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) are candidates to be passed/retrieved through the function calls.


> All primitive types	- **Except symbols**
> Boolean object	 
> String object	 
> Date	 
> RegExp	- **The lastIndex field is not preserved**
> Blob	 
> File	 
> FileList	 
> ArrayBuffer	 
> ArrayBufferView	- **All typed arrays (like Int32Array etc.)**
> ImageData	 
> Array	 
> Object	- **Just plain objects (e.g. from object literals)**
> Map	 
> Set	 

- Because the worker allows natively **powerfull interactions throught the standard Messages**, this library lets you use them, in order to unlease the real power of workers (and make use of trafereable objects, sharedArrayBuffers...)


## Node support
Until Workers API is available in Node, this library is exclusive for Browsers.

Worker support
